    "There are multiple ways to manage a large amount of code, and all of them\n",
    "revolve around organising your code into logical \"boxes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows for two ways to do this: Objects and packages (and a mixture of both).\n",
    "The main difference between the two is that packages are simply a collection\n",
    "of functions and data, whereas objects are \"active\" in the sense that they can maintain\n",
    "and modify their history.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider a file that has two functions: __area(len, wid)__ and __perimeter(len, wid)__.\n",
    "To calculate either, we need to give as input the length and width (of the appropriate\n",
    "rectangle, say).\n",
    "\n",
    "on the other hand, if we have an object called __Rectangle(len, width)__, which initially\n",
    "stores the length and width and is therefore an \"instance\" of a rectangle and not just a\n",
    "collection of functions. Then we can see what the area or perimeter of __this particular__\n",
    "rectangle is by simply calling __Rectangle.area()__ without any arguments since it already\n",
    "knows what its length and width is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these approaches have their use, and most Python packages use both."
